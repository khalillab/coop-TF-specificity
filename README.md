### Genomic Binding Site Frequency
R script that determines Zinc finger binding site frequencies in the yeast genome (UCSC.sacCer3)

### Population Genetics Model
Population genetics model describing an evolving population of yeast harboring ZF regulators. Description of model in provided jupyter notebook.

### Thermodynamic Model
Thermodynamic model of transcription driven by ZF regulators. The model is used to assess the effect of transcription factor cooperativity on genomic specificity. Matlab code to generate the figures in the main and supplemental text have been provided. (Matlab 2016b)
